# KeyboardTest
This is a modified version of the original applet.
<br><br>
This version has following features:<br>
Nearly functional module of importing and exporting configs.<br>
Batch drawing rectangles according to given arguments (length, width, distance).
<br><br>
Although current version is not a perfect one, it can also be referenced for future development. It's expected to modify this program, for example, to import .json file that is previously generated and create button layout.
<br><br>
In addition, keyboard buttons are ordered in their IDs, such as "1" to "9" and "a" to "z". By using the order of buttons to batch generate mapping table binding buttons IDs and their positions (that they should be placed). (In .json format, the applet has added support for .json files.)
